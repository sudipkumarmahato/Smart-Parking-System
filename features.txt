Build a Smart Parking System:

The Smart Parking System will allow users to reserve and pay for parking spots in a parking lot. The system should include the following features:

1) User authentication and authorization: Users should be able to sign up, sign in, and log out. The system should also include role-based access control to ensure users only have access to the parking spots they are authorized to reserve.

2) Parking lot management: The system should allow parking lot managers to create and manage the parking spots, including their location and availability.

3) Parking spot reservation: Users should be able to search for available parking spots and reserve them for a specific date and time.

4) Payment processing: Users should be able to pay for their parking spot reservation using a payment gateway.

5) Parking spot occupancy tracking: The system should track the occupancy of the parking spots and prevent multiple users from reserving the same spot at the same time.

6)Parking spot release: The system should release the parking spot reservation after the specified time has passed, allowing the spot to be reserved by another user.
